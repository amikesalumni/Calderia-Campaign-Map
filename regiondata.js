They chose to investigate the pillars, finding an underground goblin encampment. Diablito is as mischievous as one might expect, Jingles has mad one liners, and Jude is a one earth genasi army.",
                          "Captain Fausta sent Malevir, Jon, and Jingles to examine two possible sites for a future base. The sites were the clearing in the rocky plain, and the two pillars surrounded by a ring of flowers. We were accompanied by Don, a craftsman (not a fighter) who determined the viability of each site, and three scouts, Erwin, Oliver, and Olivia. The party went to the site of the pillars first, and saw 6 goblins riding worgs. Jingles disguised himself as a fellow goblin, and convinced them to leave the site under the premise of recruiting members for a goblin alliance, in what was surely the greatest acting performance ever seen in Calderia. The site was deemed viable by Don, and the party moved to the rocky plains. Upon arriving in the clearing, Jon discovered a thri-kreen, and waved to it. The thri-kreen ran away from the party, rather than communicate with us. This site was also deemed acceptable, but the party decided that the pillars location would be more advantageous, and determined that would be the location of the first outpost. While returning to the fort, the party passed by the pillars again, and found 8 goblins riding worgs now. They chose to attack rather than negotiate terms of the goblin alliance this time. The party defeated the goblins while only taking minor damage and no fatalities. Captain Fausta was pleased with the progress made, and began planning for the expedition to begin construction of the outpost.",
                          "The adventurers accepted the mission from Captain Fausta to defend the building crews while they erected an outpost at the site of the pillars. While accepting the mission, they noticed that the Captain was armed with the magic sword from Philius's shop, which she claimed to be borrowing. A very large defensive force was conscripted, with a company situated at each of the cardinal directions in case of attack. The company to the East was attacked by a band of goblins, and required assistance from our heroes to fend them off. While this was going on, a second, larger force attacked the North company, led by Captain Fausta. As the smaller band of goblins was almost completely handled, the adventurers moved against the new attackers.</br></br>Our adventurers arrived to find hobgoblins attacking the company, as well as a group of bugbears surrounding Captain Fausta. These enemies appeared to be led by a magical figure on the edge of the battle field who was commanding a second group of bugbears, a powerful but unidentified figure, and an enormous black wolf the leader used as a mount. The figure was seen casting fireball just before the party arrived to help. Our heroes began to intervene, but were buffeted by a magical hailstorm before all of them could join the fight. The Captain was knocked unconscious by the bugbears surrounding her as the party began to beat back the attackers. Eventually the enemies were forced into a retreat (taking the magical sword from Captain Fausta as they did), just as the adventurers and company were beginning to show signs of fatigue. The sword was recovered however, and returned to the Captain's possession. Following the retreat, our heroes were able to return to the fort and rest, as well as care for the wounded soldiers. The mission was ultimately considered a success, despite the significant casualties endured."]

The trio took to the eerie forest, where they were met with an oppressive darkness, webbing and lifeless trees. Upon flying to look around, Nowhere seemed to land the trio in a bit of a pickle where they encountered an ettercap, wolf spiders and spider swarms. After a short rest, the trio took a note from the spiders book and set their own ambush, luring arachnids from the den and trapping them by lighting their webs aflame. The trio didn't fully explore the den as they preferred to do so, and hopefully encounter its spoils, with a team of greater numbers. ",

They had the privilege of meeting Shrek, Fiona, Donkey, and Puss in Boots. Nowhere sampled some swamp-stew. After asking for information about the island, they were told that the frogs would really know the most, but not to meet the frogs because they have a monster that devours everything. Naturally, the party went to meet the frogs and took Donkey, who said he enjoys seeing the frogs and may grant them safer passage. </br></br>In the frog (bullywug) village, the party was ushered to a back cave where they met the frog leader. After lying marginally successfully that the party had not, in fact, killed a ton of frogs on an earlier mission, the frog leader struck a deal with our adventurers: bring back some renegades with the town’s treasure, and the leader would choose to believe the party wasn’t involved and would grant information about the island. </br></br>The party left and found the renegades. Gix, the lead renegade, said that the frog leader (Gix’s dad) sacrificed villagers to “the Voracious One” (an underwater monster in the middle of the village) following the genocide of the frog farmers. Our adventurers allied themselves with the renegades to improve chances of weakening the Voracious One. (Donkey peaced out, as a general pacifist.) Together with some renegades, our adventurers set up an ambush and managed to kill “Dad” and some bullywug bruisers while the renegades helped some of the villagers escape the town</br></br>" + "Gix, the lead renegade, repaid the adventurers with gold and a nice serrated rapier. Gix and his renegade/villager crew will settle in the original swamp for now but fear encountering the genocidal maniacs who killed their brethren, so they want to resettle soon. If the party returns to kill the Voracious One, the bullywugs may assist so they can reclaim their village. Visiting Shrek & Co. on the way back revealed an annoyed Shrek, Fiona, Donkey, and Puss packing up their belongings. Now that there are very few frog villagers left to continue feeding it, the Voracious One will likely begin expanding its territory. Puss gave some information regarding the monster: It has tentacles, a huge maw, and a tongue that can reach large distances, and fire appears ineffective against it because of the"+

Through some quick thinking, use of tools, and really killer Thunderwave action, they managed to eventually kill the beast, but not before Malevir was briefly swallowed. Everyone escaped with their lives except the Froghemoth. After, they checked out one of the old leader's bodyguards, who had appeared at the beginning and yelled at them. After doing some questioning (by Gix, in their native language), the party got the impression that the bodyguard had been possessed in some capacity by the Froghemoth and now recalled bits and pieces of another's memories. The being that was/became the Froghemoth seemed to come from another realm of some sort, coming through a glowing hole in a lake and later battling two armies. The Froghemoth was, to its knowledge, the last of its kind on the island, though there used to be many. Gix and his people will now move back to that swamp on the eastern side of the river to stay."]

The stone circle was surrounded by a small moat, patrolled by black ravens, and its center was obscured by some sort of magical effect. As they approached the circle, the ravens mostly dispersed with one remaining raven transforming into an imp. The imp (speaking infernal) warned the party to stay back, away from the circle, which went unheeded.

There was evidence of a horrible-seeming battle and it looked like a large weight had been dragged off to the east-ish. Upon traveling further north, the adventurers overheard conversation (or, more accurately, berating) in Common. Upon approaching, they discovered two transparent beings (Edward the White and Edward the Blue) and an undead being. All asserted that they were Edward Dugner, though the undead one called himself Eddie. Eager to restore the undead back to being dead, the adventurers assisted these beings in the hopes of laying their spirits to rest by finding the object of their “pull” back to the mortal world. They journeyed further toward two twin peaks. This mission became complicated when a roc scooped up Eddie, and the adventurers tried very hard to rescue him before he was carried off. They discovered a cave with a smallish being named Rufus and his cat. Rufus explained that there had been a shipwreck some time ago and he was the main servant to the ship’s crew, all of whom had journeyed out from the cave after Edward/Eddie to find food. The adventurers were told/it was implied that finding Edward’s sword, which the other crewmates had taken to find food, would lay the spirits to rest when reunited with his zombie body. The adventurers first recaptured Eddie by ascending one of the peaks, battling several nests of Aarakocra and two air elementals, and eventually leaping off the cliff’s edge to Feather Fall to the ground. They returned Eddie (now a torso with detached appendages) to the cave. To recover the sword, they ascended the second of the twin peaks, finding a family of goats (some very large for goats). They encountered a stone-being, but managed to remain peaceful and recover the sword from under a rock (where it was crushed with a body).</br></br>" + "Upon returning to the cave, there was significant convincing by Edward the White for the adventurers to instead kill Edward the Blue, including bribery with information about 'deeper things happening on the island.' " + 
          "However, the adventurers would not be dissuaded from laying the dead to rest and killed Eddie and Edward the White. Of note, Edward the White was actually absorbed into the sword after putting up a fight. Edward the Blue faded away after telling the adventurers to keep his gold and the location of their shipwreck (the western side of the northern river). Rufus and his cat returned with the adventurers. On the way home, they noted a marching column of orcs traveling along the plateau toward Quyaz. Jon had to perform a death saving throw. Malevir and Lazrim experimented with fun new spells. Nowhere killed (basically) everything she set her mind to, but was unable to coax a cat to follow her. They await more information regarding the mysterious sword."]

They came into an open space of land featuring a large mound in the distance with a structure atop it. Upon further investigation by Nowhere, the structure was determined to be a castle and did not seem to have much activity inside of it. The party walked up to the main gate on the west side of the castle and noticed that despite the lack of perceived activity, the building seemed to be well taken care of. They enter the larger castle structure through the main gate, and enter an inn they found near the entrance. The inn is unoccupied, but does not appear to have been deserted for a long period of time. The party find a heavily reinforced door in the cellar of the inn, and are unable to break it down or pick the lock. They eventually give up on the cellar and go to the inner section of the castle, where they are greeted by a pair of white abishai. The pair introduces the party to a being, Annos, who is in the service of Lord Arraka. Annos offers to trade information for gold or souls with the party, and Malevir trades some of his gold for information.</br></br>After Annos and Malevir return to the group, Annos reveals that the castle is situated on cursed land, and there is an army of the undead bearing down on them all. Annos and his 4 white abashai go to leave, when Lazrim snares Annos in a web as he transforms into a green abashai. Jon discovers an inscription stating that the curse will be broken if they can recite the histories inscribed throughout the castle. The group explores the entire castle complex, and is able to find all four inscriptions. They move to an underground passageway, where a new inscription says that the party must kill four undead members of Arraka's original crew for the curse to be lifted. This crew consisting of a mage, gladiator, archer, and veteran, and several members of our party took serious damage.</br></br>The party eventually defeated the four undead crewmates, revealing an underground passageway out of the castle. Finding no more undead outside the castle pursuing them they concluded that the curse was broken and returned home."]
